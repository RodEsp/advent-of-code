# Advent of Code 2024

## Running the puzzle code

To run the code for a specific puzzle, you will need to run the corresponding file as a module. For example, to run the code for the first part of the first puzzle, you would use the following command from the `2024` directory:
> I used Python `3.12.7` for this project

```bash
python -m puzzles.1.part_1
```

### Input
Make sure you add your own puzzle input to a file in a `./data/day_X.txt` file.

For example, if you want to run part_1 for day one, you need to create `advent-of-code/2024/data/day_1.txt` and copy your puzzle input into it.
